I'm an IT guy, but also fell in love with making artworks from animes, games, toys, figures, and some famous artists. It all started from high school, making WPAP artworks for fun and commissions for friends, to college making event posters, logos and banners, and now my artworks consists of these low-poly-styled portraits of people faces, anime characters, toys figure, and who knows what will i do next but currently, i love what i do and i think i found my original style in here.
